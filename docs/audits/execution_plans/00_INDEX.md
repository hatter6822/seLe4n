# TPI-D07 Execution Plan — Master Index

## Service Dependency Acyclicity Invariant: `sorry` Elimination

**Target:** Replace the deferred `sorry` at `SeLe4n/Kernel/Service/Invariant.lean:394` with a complete formal proof of `serviceRegisterDependency_preserves_acyclicity`.

**Tracked issue:** TPI-D07 from [`AUDIT_v0.11.0_TRACKED_PROOF_ISSUES.md`](../AUDIT_v0.11.0_TRACKED_PROOF_ISSUES.md#issue-tpi-d07-in-progress--service-dependency-acyclicity-invariant)

**Classification:** Proof-only closure — no operational code changes permitted.

## Risk 0 resolution

**Decision D1 resolved: Strategy B adopted** — The vacuous BFS-based `serviceDependencyAcyclic` definition has been corrected to use declarative non-trivial-path acyclicity. Layer 0 definitions (`serviceEdge`, `serviceReachable`, `serviceHasNontrivialPath`) are committed. The preservation theorem's `sorry` now represents a genuine (non-vacuous) proof obligation. See [05_RISK_REGISTER.md](./05_RISK_REGISTER.md#risk-0--vacuous-invariant-definition-highest--resolved) for the full decision record.

## Status dashboard

| Milestone | Status | Key deliverable | Blocking risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | `IN PROGRESS` | Proof-target map, store lemma inventory | None (Risk 0 resolved) |
| M1 | `PENDING` | Structural lemmas (Layer 1) | None |
| M2 | `PENDING` | `serviceHasPathTo_false_implies_not_reachable` | R1: Fuel adequacy |
| M3 | `PENDING` | `sorry` elimination in preservation theorem | R3: BFS loop invariant |
| M4 | `PENDING` | 3+ new test cases in `NegativeStateSuite.lean` | None |
| M5 | `PENDING` | All 4 doc files updated, `test_full.sh` passes | R4: Documentation drift |

## Milestone dependency graph

```
M0 ──→ M1 ──→ M2 ──→ M3 ──→ M4 ──→ M5
                              │
                              └── sorry eliminated here
```

All milestones are strictly sequential — each depends on the prior milestone's definitions and lemmas. M4 and M5 are logically independent of each other but both depend on M3 for the proof closure.

## Quick-start reading order

1. **Understand the problem:** [`03_ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md`](./03_ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md)
2. **See the proof plan:** [`04_THEOREM_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md`](./04_THEOREM_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md)
3. **Assess risk:** [`05_RISK_REGISTER.md`](./05_RISK_REGISTER.md)
4. **Implement sequentially:** M0 → M1 → M2 → M3 → M4 → M5

## Relationship to prior execution strategy

This multi-file execution plan expands and supersedes the former monolithic `AUDIT_v0.11.0_TPI-D07_EXECUTION_STRATEGY.md` (deleted as redundant). All substantive content has been preserved, refined, and extended with:

- More precise Lean 4 proof tactic suggestions for each lemma
- Expanded BFS loop invariant formalization with explicit well-founded recursion analysis
- Concrete `storeServiceState` frame-condition reasoning patterns
- Refined fuel adequacy analysis grounded in the actual `services : ServiceId → Option ServiceGraphEntry` domain
- Additional edge cases and proof obligations identified through direct code inspection
- Explicit decision records for the invariant-definition strategy (Option 1 vs Option 2)
