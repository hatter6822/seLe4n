# Workstream History

This document is the canonical record of all completed and planned workstreams
for the seLe4n project. It consolidates workstream information that was
previously spread across README.md, GitBook chapters, and audit plans.

## How to use this document

- **New contributors**: skim the "What's next" section to understand current
  priorities, then jump to the linked audit plans for details.
- **Returning contributors**: check "What's next" for the current slice, then
  review the completed workstream closest to your area of interest.
- **Auditors**: use the portfolio table as a traceability index linking each
  workstream to its version, scope, and evidence.

## What's next

### Remaining WS-H workstreams

WS-H1..H16 are all completed. No remaining WS-H workstreams.

### WS-F workstreams (F1-F8) — ALL COMPLETED

All WS-F workstreams are completed. The v0.12.2 audit remediation portfolio is
100% closed (33/33 findings). See the
[workstream plan](audits/AUDIT_v0.12.2_WORKSTREAM_PLAN.md) for details.

| ID | Focus | Priority |
|----|-------|----------|
| **WS-F5** | Model fidelity (word-bounded badge, order-independent rights, deferred ops) | Medium — **COMPLETED** (v0.14.9) |
| **WS-F6** | Invariant quality (tautology reclassification, adapter proof hooks) | Medium — **COMPLETED** |
| **WS-F7** | Testing expansion (oracle, probe, fixtures) | Low — **COMPLETED** |
| **WS-F8** | Cleanup (dead code, dead type constructors, extension labeling) | Low — **COMPLETED** |

### WS-I workstreams (I1-I5) — Improvement recommendations from v0.14.9 audit

The v0.14.9 comprehensive codebase audit identified 18 non-blocking improvement
recommendations across testing, proof quality, documentation, code quality, and
coverage expansion. These are organized into 5 workstreams across 3 phases. See
the [workstream plan](audits/AUDIT_v0.14.9_IMPROVEMENT_WORKSTREAM_PLAN.md) for
full details.

| ID | Focus | Priority |
|----|-------|----------|
| **WS-I1** | Test infrastructure hardening (inter-transition assertions, determinism promotion, scenario ID traceability) | HIGH — **COMPLETED** (v0.15.0) |
| **WS-I2** | Proof & hygiene strengthening (L-08 regex upgrade, HashMap.fold migration, NI CDT frame lemmas, VSpace memory projection) | HIGH — pending |
| **WS-I3** | Documentation completeness (codebase map automation, GitBook Tier 3 chapter, claim-evidence gap closure) | MEDIUM — pending |
| **WS-I4** | Code quality refinement (RuntimeContract documentation, Service subsystem docstring expansion) | LOW — pending |
| **WS-I5** | Coverage expansion (scheduler edge-case scenarios, information-flow declassification tests, platform contract stress tests) | LOW — pending |

### Raspberry Pi 5 hardware binding

After the remaining workstreams, the next major milestone is populating the RPi5
platform stubs with hardware-validated contracts:

1. Populate RPi5 runtime contract with hardware-validated predicates.
2. Implement ARMv8 multi-level page table walk as a `VSpaceBackend` instance.
3. Implement GIC-400 interrupt routing with IRQ acknowledgment.
4. Bind timer adapter to ARM Generic Timer (CNTPCT_EL0).
5. Define boot sequence as a verified initial state construction.

### Long-horizon items

- MCS scheduling contexts (budget/period/replenishments).
- Multi-core support (per-core kernel instances).
- Device memory and IOMMU modeling.
- Cryptographic attestation of kernel image.
- Side-channel analysis at hardware binding layer.
