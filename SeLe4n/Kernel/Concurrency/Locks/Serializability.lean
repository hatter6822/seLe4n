# WS-SM SM3.E — Serializability under two-phase locking

This module proves the second architectural keystone of SM3 (after SM3.D's
deadlock-freedom): **every interleaved execution of kernel transitions under
strict two-phase locking is conflict-equivalent to a serial execution** — the
serial order being the commit-time order (Bernstein et al. 1987, "Concurrency
Control and Recovery in Database Systems").

## The transition-instance model (plan §5.5)

Where SM3.D's `KernelExecution` is a *static lock-state snapshot*, SM3.E reasons
about *schedules* — sequences of committed transition instances.  A
`KernelTransitionInstance` records, for one kernel transition occurrence:

* `lockSet`     — the static SM3.B lock footprint it acquires,
* `core`        — the executing core,
* `commitTime`  — the moment it releases its last lock (its commit point under
                  strict 2PL),
* `acquireTime` — when it acquired each lock (`LockId → Nat`),
* `action`      — the pure business state transformation (the transition body;
                  lock acquire/release is `withLockSet`'s job, SM3.C, not the
                  action's).

An *execution* (interleaved or serial) is a `List KernelTransitionInstance`.
`applySequential` folds the actions in list order.  Under strict 2PL each
transition commits atomically (SM3.C.7 `lockSet_observer_atomic`), so the net
effect of an interleaved execution is the commit-ordered application of its
transitions' actions — exactly what `applySequential` computes on the
commit-order schedule.

## What is proved

* **SM3.E.1** `conflictOrder` — two instances conflict-order when they share a
  lock in conflicting modes and the first commits no later than the second
  acquires that lock.
* **SM3.E.2** `serialEquivalent` — an interleaved schedule is serial-equivalent
  to a serial one when they produce the same final state.
* **SM3.E.3** `serializability_under_2pl` — every strict-2PL execution is
  serial-equivalent to the commit-sorted serial order (Theorem 2.1.10), via the
  conflict-graph acyclicity (the serialization order is the topological sort)
  and the commuting-transposition reordering (the state-equality).
* **SM3.E.4** `strictly_2pl_preserved` — every transition built by `withLockSet`
  holds all its locks until commit (no early release).
* **SM3.E.5** ≥8 commutativity lemmas — non-conflicting operation pairs commute.
* **SM3.E.6** `singleCore_proof_preservation` (Corollary 2.1.11) — every
  single-core kernel-transition theorem lifts to the SMP form under the
  `lockSetHeld` precondition, reusing SM3.C.8's structural-preservation lever.

## Relationship to SM3.D

SM3.D proved deadlock-freedom by orienting the wait-for graph along the `LockId`
total order and showing it acyclic.  SM3.E proves serializability by orienting
the *conflict* graph along the commit-time order and showing it acyclic — the
same `ReachesPlus`/strict-`<`-along-edges structural argument, now over commit
times (`Nat`) rather than `LockId`s.  The two acyclicity results are the twin
levers that make SMP execution both live (deadlock-free) and correct
(serializable).

/-- WS-SM SM3.E (plan §5.5 `KernelTransitionInstance`): one occurrence of a
kernel transition in an execution.

* `lockSet`     — the SM3.B static lock footprint (which `withLockSet` acquires).
* `core`        — the core executing the transition.
* `commitTime`  — the transition's commit point: the instant it releases its last
                  lock under strict 2PL.  Distinct transitions on overlapping
                  locks have distinct commit times (lock exclusion).
* `acquireTime` — the instant each lock was acquired.  Strict 2PL requires
                  `acquireTime l ≤ commitTime` for every held `l`
                  (`followsStrict2PL`).
* `action`      — the pure business transformation the transition performs.  The
                  lock acquire/release machinery is *not* part of `action`
                  (that is `withLockSet`'s responsibility, SM3.C); `action` is the
                  transition body whose commutativity governs serializability. -/

also computes the net effect of an *interleaved* execution whose commit order is

`τ₂` acquires `l`.  This is the precedence the serialization order must respect:
under strict 2PL `τ₁` holds `l` until its commit, so `τ₂` cannot acquire `l`
before `τ₁` commits — hence the conflict is resolved in commit order. -/

no lock is released before commit.  This is the strict-2PL "hold until commit"
discipline that makes the commit order a valid serialization. -/

/-- WS-SM SM3.E.4 (plan §5.5 `strictly_2pl_preserved`): the canonical
`withLockSet`-built transition follows strict 2PL.

`withLockSet` (SM3.C.1) acquires every lock in the growing phase *before* the
action and releases in the shrinking phase *after* it.  Modelling this with a
commit time `c` and a uniform pre-commit acquire instant `a ≤ c` (every lock
acquired in the single growing phase), the resulting instance acquires every
lock no later than commit — strict 2PL holds.  The hypothesis `a ≤ c` is the
operational meaning of "the growing phase precedes the commit". -/

    acquireTime := fun _ => acquireInstant, action := action }

/-- WS-SM SM3.E.4 (`strictly_2pl_preserved`): every `withLockSet`-built
transition whose growing phase precedes its commit (`acquireInstant ≤
commitInstant`) follows strict 2PL.  This is the operational form of "all locks
acquired by a transition are released only when the body completes". -/

/-- WS-SM SM3.E.4 (the strict-2PL ⟹ commit-consistency lever): if `τ₁`
conflict-orders before `τ₂` and `τ₂` follows strict 2PL, then `τ₁` commits no
later than `τ₂`.

Proof: `conflictOrder` gives `τ₁.commitTime ≤ τ₂.acquireTime l` on the shared
lock `l`; strict 2PL of `τ₂` gives `τ₂.acquireTime l ≤ τ₂.commitTime`; compose.
This is the precise point where the strict-2PL discipline forces every conflict
to be resolved in commit order — the foundation of the serialization order. -/

order (`hComm`); the suffix folds identically afterwards.  Bernstein's bubble of

they share a conflicting lock AND `τ₁` commits strictly before `τ₂`.  Under
strict 2PL (lock exclusion) every conflicting pair has distinct commit times, so
exactly one orientation of each conflict is a `conflictPrecedes` edge — the graph
is the conflict graph oriented by commit order. -/

(Bernstein): an acyclic conflict graph admits a topological sort, which is the
serialization order.

Proof: a cycle `ConflictReaches conflictPrecedes τ τ` would force, via
`conflictReaches_commitTime_lt`, `τ.commitTime < τ.commitTime` — contradicting
`Nat.lt_irrefl`.  This mirrors SM3.D's `waitGraph_acyclic_under_2pl` exactly,
with commit time playing the role the `LockId` order played there. -/

/-- WS-SM SM3.E.3 (orientation **completeness** — where the conflict relation
genuinely drives the structure): under the strict-2PL lock-exclusion property
(conflicting transitions commit at *distinct* times), every conflicting pair is
**comparable** under `conflictPrecedes` — one orientation or the other is an edge.

Acyclicity alone (`conflictGraph_acyclic`) does not use the conflict relation —
it is `Nat.lt` irreflexivity over commit times.  *This* theorem is where
`ktiSharesConflictingLock` is essential: it shows the commit-oriented conflict
graph is not merely acyclic but a *total* orientation of every conflicting pair.
Combined with acyclicity, the conflict relation becomes a strict total order on
pairwise-conflicting transitions (`conflictPrecedes_strict_total_of_distinct_commit`),
whose unique linear extension is the commit-time serialization order — the
genuine Bernstein "acyclic conflict graph admits a serial order" content.  The
distinct-commit-times premise is the strict-2PL lock-exclusion consequence: the
transition that acquires the shared lock first holds it until its commit, so the
other commits strictly later. -/

  the commuting-transposition reordering (`commitSort_commutingReorder` +
  `applySequential_eq_of_commutingReorder`).

--
-- §6b's `serializability_under_2pl` takes `outOfOrderCommute` as a hypothesis.
-- That hypothesis is NOT an arbitrary assumption: it is a consequence of the
-- strict-2PL discipline, exactly as SM3.D §7 grounds its 2PL + ordering
-- hypotheses in the SM3.B canonical sort.  This section discharges
-- `outOfOrderCommute` from (a) the strict-2PL lock-exclusion property
-- (`conflictsCommitOrdered`: conflicting pairs appear in commit order, so no
-- conflicting pair is out of commit order) and (b) the commutativity of
-- non-conflicting transitions (the SM3.E.5 witness — reads and disjoint

-- 2PL" name rigorous rather than nominal.

/-- WS-SM SM3.E.3 grounding: the strict-2PL **lock-exclusion** property, phrased
recursively over a schedule.  For the head transition and every later `x`, if the
head commits strictly *after* `x` (i.e. they are out of commit order), then they
do NOT share a conflicting lock.

This is the operational consequence of strict 2PL: a conflicting pair out of
commit order would require the later-committing transition to have acquired the
shared lock first and yet committed second — impossible when each holds its locks
until commit (lock exclusion).  So in a strict-2PL execution every conflicting
pair is already in commit order. -/

-- * **Structural** `actionsCommute` (`τ₁.action ∘ τ₂.action = τ₂.action ∘
--   τ₁.action`) — holds exactly for the read-only (identity-action) and
--   disjoint-subsystem (different SystemState field) pairs.  These feed the
--   structural `serializability_under_2pl` (§6) directly.
--
-- * **Observational** `objStoreEquiv` (the two orders agree on every object-store
--   lookup) — the correct notion for two writes to *different objects*.  The
--   object store is a Robin-Hood hash table whose internal slot layout depends on
--   insertion order, so two inserts at distinct keys are observationally — but
--   not structurally — equal.  Conflict-serializability is an observational
--   property (Bernstein: equivalent schedules agree on the *database state*), so
--   `objStoreEquiv` is the faithful equivalence for the write/write case.

-- §8 — Single-core proof preservation (SM3.E.6, Corollary 2.1.11)
-- ============================================================================
--
-- The architectural lever that keeps WS-SM's proof cost tractable: every
-- existing single-core kernel-transition theorem lifts to the SMP form for free,
-- gated only by (a) the `lockSetHeld` precondition — established by the
-- `withLockSet` growing phase (SM3.C.8 `acquireAll_establishes_lockSetHeld`) —
-- and (b) lock-insensitivity of the invariant — discharged structurally per
-- invariant class (SM3.C.8 foundation lemmas).  The single-core proof of the
-- action itself is reused verbatim.

/-- WS-SM SM3.E.6 (Corollary 2.1.11, invariant form): a single-core invariant
preserved by a transition's action is preserved by the transition's
`withLockSet`-wrapped SMP form, provided the invariant is lock-insensitive (the
acquire and release folds preserve it).  This is the SM3.C.8
`withLockSet_invariant_preserved` lever re-stated as the SM3.E.6 deliverable:
the single-core preservation proof (`hAction`) transfers verbatim. -/

/-- WS-SM SM3.E.6 (Corollary 2.1.11, **pre→post** meta-theorem — the general
form): if a single-core transition `op` establishes a postcondition `post` from a
precondition `pre` (`hSingleCore`), then its `withLockSet`-wrapped SMP form
establishes `post` from `pre`.

The three phases mirror `withLockSet`:
* **growing** — `pre` is lock-insensitive (`hPreAcq`), so it survives the acquire
  fold, and the action runs on a state satisfying `pre`;
* **action** — the single-core theorem `hSingleCore` gives `post` on the action's
  output (its proof is reused verbatim — this is the lever);
* **shrinking** — `post` is lock-insensitive on release (`hPostRel`), so it
  survives the release fold.

No re-proof of `op` is needed: the single-core argument applies because, under
`lockSetHeld` (established by the growing phase, see
`withLockSet_growing_phase_establishes_lockSetHeld`), no other core mutates the
locked objects, exactly as the single-core proof assumes. -/
