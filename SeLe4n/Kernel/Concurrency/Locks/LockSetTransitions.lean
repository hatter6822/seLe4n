# WS-SM SM3.B.3 / B.4 — Per-transition `lockSet` declarations + `lockSet_consistent`

For each of seLe4n's 25 kernel syscall transitions (mirroring the
`SyscallId` enumeration in `Model/Object/Types.lean`), this module
declares the static `LockSet` describing the upper-bound footprint
of the transition's per-object lock acquisitions.

The `lockSet` declarations are **pure functions of the
post-cap-resolution arguments**: they take resolved `ObjId`s
(post-CSpace-lookup) plus the caller's `ThreadId`, and return a
`LockSet` declaring which (kind, ObjId, mode) tuples the transition
acquires.

Per plan §4.1, lockSet is the *union over all paths* — a transition
that may or may not touch an object (e.g., a receiver TCB that only
matters if a thread is blocked on the endpoint) declares the
upper-bound, conservatively over-locking but never under-locking.
Optional ObjIds enter via `Option ObjId` parameters: `none` means
the transition does NOT touch that object; `some oid` adds the
corresponding LockId to the set.

The `lockSet_consistent` theorem (SM3.B.4) is the structural
invariant: for every declared `(LockId, AccessMode)` in any
`lockSet_<τ>`, the `LockId.kind` is in the transition's permitted
set of kinds.

## Design choice: post-resolution args

The plan's pseudocode for `lockSet_endpointCall` uses raw `CPtr`s.
We use resolved `ObjId`s for two reasons:

1. **Static-ness**: a `lockSet` taking `CPtr`s would implicitly
   depend on the CSpace state (which the CPtr resolves through).
   The plan §4.1 requires lockSet to be a pure function of `(τ,
   args)` — no state.  Taking resolved ObjIds matches this.
2. **2PL ordering**: by the time SM3.C's `withLockSet` calls a
   transition, the caller has already done the cap-lookup
   (protected by the ObjStore lock at level 0 and the CNode locks
   at level 2).  The post-resolution args are the natural
   acquisition-time view.

For SM3.C's `withLockSet` to thread these properly, the caller
will perform the cap lookup (read the ObjStore and CNode in read
mode), then call `lockSet_<τ>` with the resolved ObjIds to compute
the per-object lock-set, then `withLockSet` to acquire.

## Naming convention

`lockSet_<syscallName>` where `<syscallName>` matches the
`SyscallId` variant (camelCase).  The argument order is:

  callerTid : ThreadId    -- the calling thread (always present)
  <required ObjIds>       -- transition-specific resolved ObjIds
  <optional ObjIds>       -- Option ObjId for path-dependent locks

ObjStore is **NOT** declared in per-transition lockSets — every
transition implicitly holds the ObjStore lock (in read mode for
most paths, write mode for those that insert/erase entries).
SM3.C will add the ObjStore lock as a wrapper at acquisition time.

## Audit-pass-3 (FIX): donation-path locks added per plan §4.1

Audit-pass-2 documented (rather than implemented) that 4
syscalls may traverse a SchedContext-donation path beyond their
directly-named-object footprint.  Per CLAUDE.md's
`Implement-the-improvement` rule (and plan §4.1's "lockSet is
the union over all paths" requirement), audit-pass-3 **fixes**
the gap by adding pre-resolved `Option SchedContextId` and
`Option ThreadId` arguments to the affected `lockSet_<τ>`
functions.

The 4 affected syscalls and their donation extensions:

* **`lockSet_endpointCall`** — adds `donatedScId : Option
  SchedContextId`.  When the caller has an active SC and the
  receiver is passive, `applyCallDonation` updates the SC's
  `boundThread` (write to SC).  Caller and receiver TCBs are
  already in the lockSet.

* **`lockSet_endpointReply`** — adds `donatedScId : Option
  SchedContextId`.  When the replier has a `.donated scId
  originalOwner` binding, `returnDonatedSchedContext` updates
  the SC + replier TCB + originalOwner TCB.  In the reply
  context, `originalOwner = replyTargetTid` (the original
  client), so the origin-owner TCB is already in the lockSet.
  Only the SC is a new lock.

* **`lockSet_replyRecv`** — adds `donatedScId : Option
  SchedContextId`.  Same as reply (the receive phase doesn't
  initiate donation — donation is caller-initiated via
  `endpointCall`, not receiver-initiated).

* **`lockSet_tcbSuspend`** — adds `bindingScId : Option
  SchedContextId` AND `donatedOriginalOwnerTid : Option
  ThreadId`.  `cancelDonation` dispatches:
  - `.unbound`: no extra locks.
  - `.bound scId`: writes SC + suspended TCB.  Suspended TCB
    already in lockSet; SC is new.
  - `.donated scId originalOwner`: writes SC + suspended TCB +
    originalOwner TCB.  Suspended TCB already in lockSet; SC
    and originalOwner TCB are new.

The caller is expected to pre-inspect the relevant TCB (under
the ObjStore read-lock + the TCB's read-lock acquired
temporarily for the inspection — sound under non-strict 2PL)
to extract these args BEFORE computing the lockSet and
acquiring it via `withLockSet`.  This pattern keeps `lockSet`
itself a pure function of `(τ, args)` while covering all
donation paths.

### Syscalls that do NOT need donation extension

* **`lockSet_endpointSend`**: send is asynchronous, no
  donation.
* **`lockSet_endpointReceive`**: receive blocks waiting; if a
  caller arrives and donates, the donation is initiated from
  the caller's `endpointCall` syscall — handled there.
* **`lockSet_notificationSignal/Wait`**: notifications don't
  donate.
* **`lockSet_cspaceMint/Copy/Move/Delete`**: capability ops
  don't touch SCs.
* **`lockSet_lifecycleRetype`**: retype creates new objects
  (born unbound), no donation.
* **`lockSet_vspaceMap/Unmap`**: VSpace ops don't touch SCs.
* **`lockSet_serviceRegister/Revoke/Query`**: service-level
  ops don't touch SCs.
* **`lockSet_schedContextConfigure`**: only changes SC params
  + bound TCB domain; bound TCB is already in lockSet.
* **`lockSet_schedContextBind`**: requires SC to be currently
  unbound (precondition); no donation involved.
* **`lockSet_schedContextUnbind`**: unbinds the SC's bound
  thread; the bound thread is already in lockSet as
  `targetTcbTid`.
* **`lockSet_tcbResume/SetPriority/SetMCPriority/SetIPCBuffer`**:
  TCB-only config ops, no donation.

### PIP-chain TCB locks

Priority-inheritance propagation walks the blocking graph and
may touch arbitrarily-many TCBs in the chain.  This is
inherently dynamic and cannot be modelled in a static lockSet.
Plan §4.1's "deadlock-freedom requires knowing the lock-set in
advance" applies via the SM0.I lock-id total order: PIP-chain
TCBs are all at hierarchy level `.tcb` (3) and are acquired in
`ObjId.val` ascending order, preserving the lock-ladder
invariant.  SM3.C's `withLockSet` combinator will handle PIP
acquisition via a sub-call pattern (acquire-walk-extend) that
preserves 2PL.

/-! ## IPC syscalls (5 transitions)

The IPC paths all touch the caller's TCB (write — pending message,
queue linkage, blocked state), an endpoint (write — queue
membership), and optionally a receiver TCB (write — wake-up,
register transfer).  The CSpace lookup is wrapped by the
caller-CNode lock (read).
-/

/-- WS-SM SM3.B.3: `lockSet` for `endpointSend` (syscall `.send`).

Locks acquired:
* caller TCB (write) — sets `ThreadIpcState.blocked` or transfers
  message on rendezvous.
* caller CSpace root (read) — for cap resolution.
* endpoint (write) — enqueues caller on the endpoint's send queue
  OR pairs with a waiter (dequeue + transfer).
* receiver TCB (write, optional) — present iff the endpoint had a
  blocked receiver; the receiver's state transitions to `.ready`
  and registers are loaded.

Per plan §4.1, the receiver TCB lock is part of the lock-set's
*union over all paths*. -/
def lockSet_endpointSend (callerTid : ThreadId)
    (cnodeRootObjId : ObjId) (endpointObjId : ObjId)
    (receiverTid : Option ThreadId) : LockSet :=
  lockSetExtendOpt
    (lockSetOfList
      [(tcbLock callerTid, .write),
       (cnodeLock cnodeRootObjId, .read),
       (endpointLock endpointObjId, .write)])
    (receiverTid.map (fun rt => (tcbLock rt, .write)))

/-- WS-SM SM3.B.3: `lockSet` for `endpointReceive` (syscall `.receive`).

Symmetric to `send`: caller TCB blocks/unblocks; endpoint queue
mutates; optional sender TCB completes its handshake. -/
def lockSet_endpointReceive (callerTid : ThreadId)
    (cnodeRootObjId : ObjId) (endpointObjId : ObjId)
    (senderTid : Option ThreadId) : LockSet :=

    (senderTid.map (fun st => (tcbLock st, .write)))

/-- WS-SM SM3.B.3: `lockSet` for `endpointCall` (syscall `.call`).

A blocking RPC: caller TCB writes, endpoint writes, optional
receiver TCB writes (same shape as send + receive combined).

Audit-pass-3 (donation extension): when the caller has an active
`SchedContext` and the receiver is passive (unbound),
`applyCallDonation` rebinds the SC's `boundThread` from caller to
receiver.  The receiver's TCB binding transitions to `.donated
scId callerTid`.  The caller pre-resolves this by inspecting the
caller's own TCB:

* If `callerTcb.schedContextBinding = .bound scId`: pass
  `donatedScId := some scId`.
* If `callerTcb.schedContextBinding = .unbound` or `.donated _ _`:
  pass `donatedScId := none` (no fresh donation in this call).

The receiver's currently-unbound-vs-bound status determines
whether the actual donation runs; but the lockSet declares the
upper-bound footprint regardless, so the SC lock is included
whenever the caller HAS an active SC to potentially donate. -/
def lockSet_endpointCall (callerTid : ThreadId)
    (cnodeRootObjId : ObjId) (endpointObjId : ObjId)
    (receiverTid : Option ThreadId)

    (receiverTid.map (fun rt => (tcbLock rt, .write)))
  lockSetExtendOpt withReceiver
    (donatedScId.map (fun sc => (schedContextLock sc, .write)))

/-- WS-SM SM3.B.3: `lockSet` for `endpointReply` (syscall `.reply`).

Caller TCB (write — clearing blocked state); reply target TCB
(write — transitioning out of `BlockedReply`).

Audit-pass-3 (donation-return extension): when the replier
(=caller) has a `.donated scId originalOwner` binding,
`returnDonatedSchedContext` updates the SC + replier's TCB +
originalOwner's TCB.  In the reply context, the `originalOwner`
IS the `replyTargetTid` (the SC was originally donated from the
target's earlier `endpointCall` to the replier), so no separate
original-owner arg is needed — the existing `replyTargetTid` is
the original owner.  Only the SC is a new lock.

The caller pre-resolves this by inspecting the replier's own TCB:

* If `replierTcb.schedContextBinding = .donated scId _`: pass
  `donatedScId := some scId`.
* If `.bound _` or `.unbound`: pass `donatedScId := none` (no
  donation to return). -/
def lockSet_endpointReply (callerTid : ThreadId)
    (cnodeRootObjId : ObjId) (replyTargetTid : ThreadId)
    (donatedScId : Option SchedContextId) : LockSet :=
  lockSetExtendOpt
    (lockSetOfList
      [(tcbLock callerTid, .write),
       (cnodeLock cnodeRootObjId, .read),
       (tcbLock replyTargetTid, .write)])
    (donatedScId.map (fun sc => (schedContextLock sc, .write)))

/-- WS-SM SM3.B.3: `lockSet` for `replyRecv` (syscall `.replyRecv`).

Combined reply + receive in one transition.  Touches the caller
TCB (write — both reply-clearing and receive-blocking phases), the
endpoint (write — queue mutation in the receive phase), the
prior-call reply target TCB (write — completes the reply), and an
optional new sender TCB (write — if a sender was already
waiting).

Audit-pass-3 (donation-return extension): the reply phase may
return a donated SC from the caller (replier) to the replyTarget
— same shape as `lockSet_endpointReply`.  The receive phase does
NOT initiate donation (donation is caller-initiated from
`endpointCall`, not receiver-initiated).

The caller pre-resolves the SC by inspecting the replier's own
TCB (same as for `endpointReply`).  Only one extra Option is
needed because:

* The reply-direction donation return touches `donatedScId` (if
  the replier has `.donated`).
* The receive-direction donation reception (if a new sender
  later calls and donates) is handled at that future `endpointCall`
  syscall's own lockSet — not this `replyRecv` invocation. -/

/-! ## Notification syscalls (2 transitions) -/

/-- WS-SM SM3.B.3: `lockSet` for `notificationSignal`.

The signaller's TCB does NOT mutate (signal is non-blocking from
caller's perspective) — but we conservatively include it in read
mode since the signal path inspects the caller's identity for
badge attribution.  The notification mutates (waiter dequeue or
badge merge); the optional waiter TCB mutates (wake-up). -/

       (notificationLock notificationObjId, .write)])
    (waiterTid.map (fun wt => (tcbLock wt, .write)))

/-- WS-SM SM3.B.3: `lockSet` for `notificationWait`.

Caller TCB blocks (write); notification mutates (waiter list
append OR badge consumption); CSpace read. -/

/-! ## Capability syscalls (4 transitions) -/

/-- WS-SM SM3.B.3: `lockSet` for `cspaceMint`.

Caller TCB (read — non-mutating; cap pointers are derived from
state); source CNode (read — original cap is unchanged); target
CNode (write — minted cap is stored). -/
def lockSet_cspaceMint (callerTid : ThreadId)
    (srcCnodeObjId dstCnodeObjId : ObjId) : LockSet :=

The target CNode is the only structural mutation; the caller's
CSpace root is read for the cap-lookup path. -/

/-! ## Service syscalls (3 transitions)

Services are tracked at the SystemState level (not as per-object
RHTable entries); they take the ObjStore-level lock implicitly via
their registry table reads/writes.  At SM3.B per-object level, the

Target TCB (write — state transition to `.Inactive`); optional
endpoint/notification if the target is blocked on one (write —
queue removal).

Audit-pass-3 (donation-cancel extension): `cancelDonation`
dispatches on the suspended TCB's `schedContextBinding`:

* `.unbound`: no extra locks.
* `.bound scId`: writes the SC (clears `boundThread`,
  `isActive`).  Caller passes `bindingScId := some scId`.
* `.donated scId originalOwner`: writes the SC + the original
  owner's TCB (re-binds SC to original owner).  Caller passes
  both `bindingScId := some scId` AND
  `donatedOriginalOwnerTid := some originalOwner`.

The caller pre-resolves these by inspecting the suspended TCB's
`schedContextBinding` field before computing the lockSet. -/
