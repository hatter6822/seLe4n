# WS-SM SM2.B — TicketLock operational specification

This module contains the abstract operational specification of the
FIFO TicketLock primitive that the Rust HAL's
`rust/sele4n-hal/src/ticket_lock.rs` refines.  The spec is **pure**
(no `IO`, no `Unsafe`, zero added axioms, zero proof gaps): every
transition is a total function on the abstract `TicketLockState`,
and every theorem is mechanically discharged.

The six substantive theorems exported by this module are:

* `ticketLock_mutex` — at most one core holds the lock at any time.
* `ticketLock_wf_invariant` — every operation preserves the seven
  conjuncts of `TicketLockState.wf`.
* `ticketLock_fifo` — earlier `tryAcquire` calls capture smaller
  tickets (the FIFO foundation that SM3 ladder-acquisition lemmas
  build on).
* `ticketLock_bounded_wait` — when a core captures ticket `t`, at
  most `numCores - 1` other cores have tickets ahead of it (the
  WCRT bound that SM2.C RwLock's writer-starvation freedom is
  derived from).
* `ticketLock_release_acquire_pairing` — a release-store on the
  `serving` location synchronizes-with the next acquire-load that
  observes the released value (the release-acquire pairing that
  SM3 per-object locks consume for cross-core state visibility).
* `ticketLock_reachability` — every state reachable from `unheld`
  by a finite operation sequence satisfies `wf`.

Plus a determinism theorem (`ticketLock_applyOp_deterministic`) and
two closure-form preservation lemmas (`acquire_preserves_wf`,
`release_preserves_wf`) that SM3 / SM2.D / SM2.E consumers use.

## ARM ARM citations

The operational behaviour of the abstract `applyOp` corresponds to
the following hardware primitives:

* **`tryAcquire`** — atomic `LDADDA` (ARM ARM C6.2.116) on the
  `nextTicket` location.  Captures the ticket atomically; on
  ARMv8.1-A LSE this is one instruction.  Modelled in the memory
  trace as an RMW (load + store at the same `seqNum`).
* **`release`** — `STLR` (ARM ARM C6.2.243 / B2.3.7) on the `serving`
  location.  Release-store ordering publishes every prior write on
  the releasing core to any acquire-load that observes this value.
* **`observeServing`** — `LDAR` (ARM ARM C6.2.142) on the `serving`
  location.  Acquire-load ordering synchronises-with the
  release-store that produced the observed value.

## Axiom budget

Zero Lean `axioms`, zero `sorries`.  All hardware semantics enter as
operational constraints on the memory trace shape via the SM2.A
abstract memory model.

## Decidability

`TicketLockState.wf` carries a `Decidable` instance so test fixtures
can construct lock states and `decide` their well-formedness at
elaboration time.  The transition functions
(`captureTicket`, `applyOp`, `promotePending`, `releaseAndPromote`)
are total computable functions on `TicketLockState`.

-- SM2.B.1 — TicketLockState
-- ============================================================================

/-- **WS-SM SM2.B.1**: the abstract state of a TicketLock primitive.

The four fields capture every observable aspect of a FIFO ticket
lock at the operational-semantics level:

* `nextTicket` — the monotone counter that every acquirer increments
  to capture its position in the queue.  Corresponds to the Rust
  impl's `AtomicU64 next_ticket` field.
* `serving` — the monotone counter that the releasing core increments
  to admit the next pending core.  Corresponds to the Rust impl's
  `AtomicU64 serving` field.
* `pending` — the list of (core, ticket) pairs that have captured a
  ticket but are spinning waiting for `serving` to reach it.  The
  abstract model uses an explicit list because the spec proves FIFO
  ordering; the Rust impl tracks this implicitly through the gap
  between `next_ticket` and `serving`.
* `held` — `Option (CoreId × Nat)` carrying the current holder (if
  any).  At most one core holds the lock at any time, witnessed by
  `ticketLock_mutex`.

`Inhabited` is derived (every field has `Inhabited` — `Nat` via
`0`, `List` via `[]`, `Option` via `none`).  The default
`Inhabited` witness is **not** `unheld`; see `unheld` below for the
canonical initial state. -/

  /-- Monotone counter capturing the next ticket to be issued. -/
  nextTicket : Nat
  /-- Monotone counter capturing the ticket currently being served. -/

  /-- The (core, ticket) pairs waiting to be served. -/
  pending    : List (CoreId × Nat)

is the state every reachable trace begins in (the operational-
semantics seed for `ticketLock_reachability`). -/

-- SM2.B.3 — wf predicate (7 conjuncts)
-- ============================================================================

/-- **WS-SM SM2.B.3**: well-formedness predicate for a TicketLockState.

The seven conjuncts encode every structural invariant the operational
semantics must preserve.  Each `INV-T*` annotation matches the plan's
§3.2.2 conjunct numbering for traceability.

* **INV-T1** — `serving ≤ nextTicket`.  Counter monotonicity: the
  number served never exceeds the number issued.
* **INV-T2** — pending tickets lie in `(serving, nextTicket)`.  A
  pending ticket is strictly between the current serving and the
  next-to-issue, so the wait queue is bounded by the issued-but-not-
  served window.
* **INV-T3** — `holder.ticket = serving`.  The current holder's
  captured ticket exactly equals the serving counter.
* **INV-T4** — pending tickets are unique.  Two distinct waiters
  cannot share a ticket.
* **INV-T5** — holder's ticket is not in pending.  The holder is
  always promoted out of the pending queue.
* **INV-T6** — pending cores are unique.  A core can wait for at
  most one ticket at a time.
* **INV-T7** — pending cores disjoint from holder.  The holder is
  not simultaneously waiting.

The `match s.held with | none => True | some h => P h` form is used
for the holder-side conjuncts (T3, T5, T7) to keep decidability
elementary; the `Option`-quantifier alternative
(`∀ h ∈ s.held, P h`) is mathematically equivalent but unfolds
through `Membership.mem` and is harder for `decide` to handle.

INV-T2 is encoded via `List.all` (Bool form) plus `= true` so the
inner bounded quantifier is decidable without appealing to
`Mathlib.Data.List.Forall`.  The `pendingInRange` helper exposes the
Bool predicate for downstream use. -/

  match s.held with
  | none => true

/-- **WS-SM SM2.B.3**: well-formedness predicate for a TicketLockState.

Carries **eight conjuncts** — the seven from the plan's §3.2.2 plus
one count-parity invariant **INV-T8** that the plan's sketch omits.

### Why eight, not seven

The plan's pseudocode for `applyOp .tryAcquire` (§3.2.3) admits a
seemingly innocuous edge case: if `s.serving = s.nextTicket` AND
`s.held.isSome`, the operational step takes the `else` branch and
appends `(core, s.nextTicket)` to `pending`, producing a state that
violates INV-T2 (the new pending entry would have ticket `= serving`,
not `> serving`).

Such a state — `held = some _, serving = nextTicket` — is **not
reachable** from `unheld` by any sequence of operations, but the
seven-invariant `wf` admits it.  Per the implement-the-improvement
rule (`CLAUDE.md`), the correct remediation is to **strengthen the
invariant** so the spec captures exactly the reachable states.

INV-T8 is a count-parity invariant:
`nextTicket = serving + pending.length + heldCount`.

It says the "next ticket counter" equals the number served plus the
number in the wait queue plus the number held — every issued ticket
is accounted for.  This is the natural structural invariant for a
FIFO ticket lock and implies `held.isSome → serving < nextTicket`
plus `pending ≠ [] → serving < nextTicket`.

Under INV-T8, the troublesome state above is rejected: with
`held = some _ ∧ pending = []`, INV-T8 forces
`nextTicket = serving + 0 + 1 = serving + 1`, so `serving < nextTicket`.

The seven conjuncts encode every structural invariant the operational
semantics must preserve.  Each `INV-T*` annotation matches the plan's
§3.2.2 conjunct numbering for traceability.

* **INV-T1** — `serving ≤ nextTicket`.  Counter monotonicity: the
  number served never exceeds the number issued.
* **INV-T2** — pending tickets lie in `(serving, nextTicket)`.  A
  pending ticket is strictly between the current serving and the
  next-to-issue, so the wait queue is bounded by the issued-but-not-
  served window.
* **INV-T3** — `holder.ticket = serving`.  The current holder's
  captured ticket exactly equals the serving counter.
* **INV-T4** — pending tickets are unique.  Two distinct waiters
  cannot share a ticket.
* **INV-T5** — holder's ticket is not in pending.  The holder is
  always promoted out of the pending queue.
* **INV-T6** — pending cores are unique.  A core can wait for at
  most one ticket at a time.
* **INV-T7** — pending cores disjoint from holder.  The holder is
  not simultaneously waiting.
* **INV-T8** (new): in-flight count parity.
  `nextTicket = serving + pending.length + heldCount`.

The `match s.held with | none => True | some h => P h` form is used
for the holder-side conjuncts (T3, T5, T7) to keep decidability
elementary; the `Option`-quantifier alternative

through `Membership.mem` and is harder for `decide` to handle. -/

/-- **WS-SM SM2.B.4**: `wf` is decidable.

All seven conjuncts are decidable:

* INV-T1: `Nat.decLe`.
* INV-T2: bounded-quantifier over the finite `pending` list, where
  the predicate is conjunction of two `Nat.decLt`.
* INV-T3 / T5 / T7: discharged by `match` on `s.held` — both arms
  (`none → True`, `some h → ...`) are decidable.
* INV-T4 / T6: `List.Nodup` is decidable when the underlying
  `DecidableEq` is available (which we have for `Nat` and
  `CoreId = Fin numCores`).

The `unfold` + `inferInstance` pattern matches the SM2.A
`MemoryTrace.wellFormed` decidability proof. -/

-- SM2.B.5 — TicketLockOp
-- ============================================================================

/-- **WS-SM SM2.B.5**: the operational-semantics operations on a
TicketLock.

Three operations cover the full lifecycle:

* `tryAcquire core` — attempts to capture a ticket for `core`.
  Corresponds to the Rust impl's `acquire()` body's
  `next_ticket.fetch_add(1, Acquire)` followed by a spin-loop
  iteration.  At the abstract level, the capture and the immediate
  spin-loop's first iteration are fused — if `serving` already
  equals the captured ticket and no holder is present, the core
  is promoted to held in one step.
* `release core` — releases the lock if `core` is the current
  holder.  Corresponds to the Rust impl's
  `serving.fetch_add(1, Release)` followed by an SEV broadcast.
* `observeServing core observed` — a pure observation of the
  `serving` counter (the spin-loop body).  Does not change the
  state; included so the spec can talk about the Acquire-load
  events that the release-acquire pairing theorem cites. -/
inductive TicketLockOp where
  /-- `core` attempts to capture a ticket. -/
  | tryAcquire     (core : CoreId)
  /-- `core` releases the lock (if it currently holds). -/
  | release        (core : CoreId)
  /-- `core` observes the `serving` counter (spin-loop iteration). -/

  deriving Repr

-- ============================================================================
-- SM2.B.6 — captureTicket, observeServing, applyOp
-- ============================================================================

/-- **WS-SM SM2.B.6**: the atomic `fetch_add` capture step.

Returns the updated state and the captured ticket.  The state is
extended by:

* `nextTicket := nextTicket + 1` (the atomic increment side of
  `LDADDA`).
* `pending := (core, ticket) :: pending` (the just-captured entry
  is admitted at the head of the queue; the `applyOp` wrapper
  then removes it again if the captured ticket equals `serving`
  and no holder is present, fusing the capture with the immediate
  spin-loop's first iteration). -/
def TicketLockState.captureTicket (s : TicketLockState) (core : CoreId) :
    TicketLockState × Nat :=
  let ticket := s.nextTicket
  let s' :=
    { s with
      nextTicket := s.nextTicket + 1
      pending    := (core, ticket) :: s.pending }
  (s', ticket)

/-- **WS-SM SM2.B.6**: the pure observation step.

Returns the current `serving` counter without changing the state.
Corresponds to the Rust impl's `serving.load(Ordering::Acquire)`
inside the spin-loop body.

The function is total and computable; the `core` parameter is
informational (it identifies which core is observing, useful when
the spec is lifted to a `MemoryTrace` and an Acquire-load event
needs to be tagged with the observing core). -/
def TicketLockState.observeServing (s : TicketLockState) : Nat := s.serving

/-- **Witness (SM2.B.6)**: `observeServing` returns the current
`serving` counter exactly.

The function is the abstract counterpart to the Rust impl's
`serving.load(Ordering::Acquire)` inside the spin-loop body.  The
witness theorem makes the refinement relation explicit at the
abstract-state level: the abstract observation matches the
concrete read. -/
theorem TicketLockState.observeServing_eq_serving (s : TicketLockState) :
    s.observeServing = s.serving := rfl

/-- **WS-SM SM2.B.6**: the operational-semantics step function.

Each `TicketLockOp` maps to a single transition on the abstract
state, producing a new state.  The function is total and
deterministic — `applyOp` is the unique function from
`(state, op)` to next state (witnessed by
`ticketLock_applyOp_deterministic`).

The `tryAcquire core` arm fuses the capture and the immediate
spin-loop's first iteration:

* If `core` is already pending or held, the op is a no-op.
  (The Rust impl deadlocks on double-acquire — the second
  `acquire()` call's spin-loop never terminates because the
  same core never advances `serving` without releasing.  The
  abstract spec models this conservatively as a no-op so the
  state stays well-formed: kernel paths must avoid double-
  acquire via ladder discipline rather than relying on the
  spec to "handle" the misuse.)
* Otherwise, the capture admits a new entry to `pending`; if the
  captured ticket equals `serving` and no holder is present, the
  core is immediately promoted to held (the fused fast-path).

The `release core` arm:

* No-op if `core` is not the current holder.
* Otherwise, advances `serving` by 1, clears the holder.  The
  promotion of the next pending core is a separate step
  (`promotePending`), keeping the release and promotion proofs
  modular.

The `observeServing _ _` arm is a no-op on the state. -/
def TicketLockState.applyOp (s : TicketLockState) (op : TicketLockOp) :
    TicketLockState :=
  match op with
  | .tryAcquire core =>
      if core ∈ s.pending.map Prod.fst then s
      else if (s.held.map Prod.fst) = some core then s
      else
        let ticket := s.nextTicket
        let s' :=
          { s with
            nextTicket := s.nextTicket + 1
            pending    := (core, ticket) :: s.pending }
        if s.serving = ticket ∧ s.held.isNone then
          { s' with
            pending := s'.pending.filter (fun p => p.2 ≠ ticket)

-- ============================================================================

/-- **WS-SM SM2.B.7**: after a release, promote the pending entry
whose ticket equals the new `serving` counter (if any).

If `held` is already populated, this is a no-op (the holder must
release first).  Otherwise, the pending entry with ticket
`s.serving` is removed from the queue and promoted to held.

By INV-T4 there is at most one such pending entry; by INV-T6 we
can identify it uniquely by its `core` field as well, so the
`filter (fun p => p.1 ≠ c)` correctly removes exactly the
promoted entry. -/
def TicketLockState.promotePending (s : TicketLockState) :
    TicketLockState :=

the kernel-level release path performs; the SM2.B Rust impl's

/-- **Theorem 3.2.5.1 (SM2.B.8): the lock admits at most one holder.**

For any `TicketLockState s`, if `s.held = some (c₁, t₁)` and
`s.held = some (c₂, t₂)`, then `c₁ = c₂` and `t₁ = t₂`.

Proof: `s.held : Option (CoreId × Nat)` has at most one inhabitant
of the `some` case, and `Option.some` is injective.  The two
witnesses for the same `s.held` therefore project to the same
underlying pair.

This is the foundational mutex property the SM3 per-object lock
proofs cite when ruling out two concurrent kernel transitions on
the same lock-protected object. -/

/-- **wf-preservation case**: `release core` preserves wf.

Cases:

1. `core` is not the holder ⟹ no-op ⟹ wf preserved trivially.
2. `core` is the holder ⟹ serving++, held := none.
   * INV-T1: old serving ≤ nextTicket; since held.isSome, by
     `wf_serving_lt_nextTicket_of_held` we have old serving <
     nextTicket, so old serving + 1 ≤ nextTicket. ✓
   * INV-T2: old pending entries have ticket in (old serving,
     nextTicket); they have ticket > old serving, so ticket ≥
     old serving + 1 = new serving.  However, we need STRICT
     `new serving < ticket`.  This is the crux of the proof:
     pending entries' tickets were strictly between old serving
     and old nextTicket; after release, they're between new
     serving (= old serving + 1) and old nextTicket = new
     nextTicket.  Specifically, for any pending entry p, old
     serving < p.2 means p.2 ≥ old serving + 1 = new serving;
     combined with p.2 < nextTicket (unchanged), if p.2 = new
     serving, we'd have a "ready-to-promote" entry, but INV-T2
     in the new state only requires p.2 > new serving for non-
     promoted entries.  However, `applyOp .release` does NOT
     do the promotion — that's `promotePending`'s job — so the
     new state may have a pending entry with p.2 = new serving.
     This is INV-T2 violated.

   So **`applyOp .release` alone does NOT preserve wf** when the
   release admits a pending entry at the new serving.  This is
   why the spec exposes `releaseAndPromote = applyOp .release;
   promotePending` as the kernel-visible release operation.

Therefore we prove a **weaker** preservation for `applyOp .release`
that retains every wf clause EXCEPT INV-T2 (which may be
temporarily violated until `promotePending` runs); the full wf
preservation lands on `releaseAndPromote`. -/

/-- **wf-preservation case**: `promotePending` after `applyOp .release`
preserves wf.

The composed step `releaseAndPromote` is what kernel-level code
calls when releasing a TicketLock.  It atomically advances `serving`
by 1 and promotes the pending entry whose ticket = new `serving`
(if any).

Cases for the post-release state `s_post := s.applyOp (.release core)`:

1. `s.held = none` or `s.held = some (c, _)` with `c ≠ core`: `s_post = s`.
   Then `promotePending` looks for pending entry with ticket = old
   serving.  By INV-T3 of `s` (vacuous if `s.held = none`), and INV-T5
   (holder.ticket NOT in pending), no such entry exists; so
   `promotePending` is a no-op.  Result: wf preserved.

   Hmm, but if `s.held = none`, there might be a pending entry with
   ticket = serving!  Consider state: nextTicket = 2, serving = 0,
   pending = [(c1, 0), (c2, 1)], held = none.  This SATISFIES our
   wf (T1: 0≤2; T2: 0<0<2 fails for c1!  Wait, INV-T2 says serving <
   p.2 < nextTicket; for c1 we'd need 0 < 0, false).

   So pending entries always have ticket > serving (INV-T2).  In the
   no-op case (s_post = s), no pending entry has ticket = serving.
   So promotePending is a no-op.  Result: wf preserved.

2. `s.held = some (core, _)`: `s_post` has serving' = serving+1,
   held' = none, pending unchanged.  Then `promotePending` looks for
   pending entry with ticket = new serving = old serving + 1.
   * If no such entry exists: `promotePending` is a no-op.
     We need: result satisfies all 8 invariants.  INV-T2 may have
     "new serving" violations (pending tickets > old serving but
     not > new serving).  However, no entry has ticket = new
     serving (by hypothesis), so every entry has ticket > new
     serving.  ✓.
   * If a pending entry `(c', t')` with `t' = new serving` exists:
     `promotePending` removes it from pending and sets held := some (c', t').
     INV-T2: remaining pending entries have ticket > new serving
     (now that the boundary entry is removed).  INV-T3: new holder
     ticket = new serving. ✓.

Cases:

1. `applyOp .release core = s` (no-op: `core` not holder).  Then
   `promotePending s` finds no entry to promote (INV-T2 ⟹ no entry
   has ticket = serving; INV-T3+T5 ⟹ holder if any has ticket = serving
   and is NOT in pending), so it's also a no-op.  wf preserved.

2. `applyOp .release core` advances serving by 1 and clears held.
   Then `promotePending` operates on the intermediate state:
   * If `find?` returns none: post-state = intermediate.  Verify wf
     using the relaxed INV-T2 (`p.2 ≥ serving+1`) plus the find?-none
     witness (`p.2 ≠ serving+1`) to derive INV-T2 strict.
   * If `find?` returns some (c', t'): post-state has filtered pending
     and held = some (c', t').  Verify wf using `nodup_snd_unique_entry`
     for INV-T2/T5 and `nodup_fst_filter_length` for INV-T8. -/

monotone on `nextTicket`, and successful `tryAcquire` strictly
increments it.

This is the structural foundation of FIFO ordering: between two
successful captures (each grows `nextTicket` by 1), `nextTicket`
strictly increases.  The multi-step FIFO theorem
`ticketLock_fifo_trace` below folds this over a list of operations
to recover the standard "earlier capture → smaller ticket" claim. -/

starting from any state `s`, `nextTicket` is monotone non-decreasing.

Folded form of `ticketLock_fifo`.  The strict FIFO claim — earlier
successful capture produces a smaller ticket than a later successful
capture — follows by combining this monotonicity with
`applyOp_tryAcquire_captures` (each successful capture grows
`nextTicket` by 1, so two consecutive captures differ by at least 1). -/

/-- **Theorem (SM2.B.10, strict FIFO between two captures)**: between
two successful captures separated by any sequence of operations, the
captured tickets are strictly ordered.

Concretely: c₁ captures `s.nextTicket` at the starting state `s`; the
post-c₁ state evolves through any sequence `ops` of operations to
`s_final`; c₂ would then capture `s_final.nextTicket`.  We prove
**c₁'s captured ticket strictly precedes c₂'s captured ticket**.

The c₂-eligibility hypotheses (`h_c₂_eligible`, `h_c₂_not_held`) are
required to certify that c₂'s capture would actually succeed (i.e.,
produce `s_final.nextTicket` as its captured ticket rather than being
a no-op).  Combined with `applyOp_tryAcquire_captures`, they let the
conclusion conclude with the **captured ticket** of c₂'s successful
acquire, not just the abstract `s_final.nextTicket`.

This is the cross-trace strict-FIFO claim the plan's §3.2.7.1 states:
"if at trace positions p₁ < p₂ two cores both successfully capture
tickets t₁, t₂, then t₁ < t₂". -/

For any wf TicketLockState `s`, the captured-but-not-yet-served
window has bounded width: `s.nextTicket ≤ s.serving + numCores`.

This is the structural statement of bounded wait: when a core
captures ticket `t = s.nextTicket`, the gap `t - s.serving` is at
most `numCores - 1`, so the captured core waits behind at most
`numCores - 1` other cores.

Proof:
* INV-T6: pending cores are Nodup.
* INV-T7: holder's core is not in pending.
* Combined, the pending cores ∪ {holder} is a Nodup list of distinct
  CoreId values.
* By `nodup_corelist_length_bound`, the total count is ≤ numCores.
* By INV-T8 (count parity): nextTicket - serving = |pending| + heldCount.
* So nextTicket - serving ≤ numCores, hence nextTicket ≤ serving + numCores. -/

If a release-store event and an acquire-load event in a well-formed

preconditions (same location on the `serving` field; matching value;
release-store positioned before acquire-load; both with the right
ordering), then they `synchronizesWith` per the SM2.A abstract
memory model.

This bridges the TicketLock spec to the SM2.A `MemoryModel.lean`:
release-acquire pairing on the `serving` counter is exactly what

a `release` followed by another core's `acquire`. -/
