# WS-SM SM2.A — Abstract memory model for verified lock primitives

This module captures enough of ARMv8.1-A LSE atomic semantics to
prove the lock primitives correct.  The model is **operational**:
a trace is a sequence of memory events on shared atomic locations;
the synchronizes-with relation is derived from event order;
happens-before is the inductive transitive closure.

The four substantive theorems exported by this module form the
foundation that every SM2.B / SM2.C lock-primitive proof rests on:

* `happensBefore_irreflexive`  — no event happens-before itself
* `happensBefore_transitive`   — happens-before is closed under
                                  composition (immediate by ctor)
* `happensBefore_antisymmetric` — distinct events cannot both
                                  happens-before the other
* `happens_before_partial_order` — aggregate of the three above,
                                    the canonical surface anchor

## ARM ARM citation map (WS-SM SM2.E.3)

The abstract memory model captures, operationally, the following
hardware properties.  Each is sourced from a public ARMv8-A
Architecture Reference Manual (ARM ARM, DDI 0487 family) section
and is encoded operationally (no `axioms` introduced) by the
constraints on the `synchronizesWith` and `happensBefore` predicates.

This is the **canonical citation map** for SM2.  Every Rust HAL
docstring (`ticket_lock.rs`, `rw_lock.rs`, `lock_bridge.rs`) and
every per-lock Lean docstring (`Locks/TicketLock.lean`,
`Locks/RwLock.lean`) cites entries by their section identifier
(e.g., "ARM ARM B2.3.7") rather than restating the underlying
hardware property — keep this map authoritative.

### Ordering and synchronisation surface

* **ARM ARM B2.3.7** (Release/Acquire ordering): a Release-store on
  a location L synchronises-with the next Acquire-load on L that
  observes the released value.  Encoded by `synchronizesWith`'s
  conjuncts requiring `e_R.isWrite ∧ e_R.order.isRelease ∧
  ¬ e_A.isWrite ∧ e_A.order.isAcquire ∧ e_R.loc = e_A.loc ∧
  e_R.value = e_A.value`.  Consumers: every
  `*_release_acquire_pairing` theorem in `Locks/TicketLock.lean`
  and `Locks/RwLock.lean`.
* **ARM ARM B2.3.3** (Single-Copy Atomicity): atomic operations
  on naturally-aligned 8-byte locations are single-copy atomic.
  Encoded implicitly by modelling each `MemoryEvent` as a single
  point-in-time observation (no torn reads/writes).  Consumers:
  every `AtomicU64`-backed lock counter in `ticket_lock.rs` /
  `rw_lock.rs`; the bit-packed `state` field in `rw_lock.rs`.
* **ARM ARM B2.3.5** (External Completion): a memory access has
  externally completed for an observer when it is globally
  visible to that observer.  Encoded operationally through the
  trace's per-position observability — once an event sits at
  position `p` in the trace, every event at position `> p` may
  reference it via `synchronizesWith`.
* **ARM ARM K11.2** (Memory model — happens-before): hb is
  irreflexive, transitive, antisymmetric on the events of a
  well-formed execution.  Encoded by Theorems 3.1.8.1 / 3.1.8.2 /
  3.1.8.3 below, aggregated into `happens_before_partial_order`.
* **ARM ARM K11.3** (Coherence / per-location order): all writes
  to a single location are totally ordered, observable in that
  order by every PE.  Encoded by the trace's positional order
  plus the wellFormed Nodup conjunct (no event appears twice).

### Atomic instruction surface (ARMv8.1-A LSE)

The ARM Large System Extension (LSE) introduces single-instruction
atomic RMWs that the Rust impls use directly.  Each instruction
family is modelled as one trace position holding two events (load
+ store) sharing a single `seqNum` (audit-pass refinement: the
non-strict `≤` in `wellFormed.pairwise` accommodates this shape).

* **ARM ARM C6.2.116** (`LDADD` family — `LDADD`, `LDADDA`,
  `LDADDL`, `LDADDAL`): atomic add with optional acquire (`A`),
  release (`L`), or both (`AL`) ordering.  Consumers:
  `ticket_lock.rs`'s `next_ticket.fetch_add(1, Acquire)` →
  `LDADDA`; `serving.fetch_add(1, Release)` → `LDADDL`;
  `rw_lock.rs`'s `state.fetch_sub(1, Release)` → `LDADDL` with
  negated operand.
* **ARM ARM C6.2.50** (`CAS` family — `CAS`, `CASA`, `CASL`,
  `CASAL`): atomic compare-and-swap with optional acquire/release
  ordering.  Consumers: the rare CAS-retry paths in `rw_lock.rs`
  on platforms without LSE (the v1.0.0 RPi5 target is LSE-capable;
  pre-LSE platforms remain a port-time concern).
* **ARM ARM C6.2.103** (`LDCLR` family — `LDCLR`, `LDCLRA`,
  `LDCLRL`, `LDCLRAL`): atomic bit-clear with optional acquire/
  release ordering.  Consumers: `rw_lock.rs`'s `release_write`
  uses `state.fetch_and(READER_MASK, Release)` → `LDCLRL` with
  the writer-bit mask negated (audit fix H-4 — the original
  `store(0, Release)` would wipe reader bits on misuse).
* **ARM ARM C6.2.135** (`LDXR` / `LDAXR` exclusive-load family):
  load-exclusive with optional acquire ordering.  Pre-LSE
  building block for CAS retry pairs.
* **ARM ARM C6.2.323** (`STXR` / `STLXR` exclusive-store family):
  store-exclusive with optional release ordering.  Pre-LSE
  building block for CAS retry pairs.
* **ARM ARM C6.2.142** (`LDAR` family — `LDAR`, `LDARH`, `LDARB`):
  acquire-load.  Consumers: `ticket_lock.rs`'s
  `serving.load(Acquire)` in the WFE spin loop;
  `rw_lock.rs`'s `state.load(Acquire)` in the CAS-retry head.

### Memory barriers

The kernel-side barrier surface lives in `Architecture.BarrierKind`
and `Concurrency.Types.dsbForSharing` (SM0.F).  The abstract memory
model does not directly model barriers — they are implicit in the
per-event acquire/release ordering.  Production-side citations:

* **ARM ARM C6.2.94** (`DMB`): Data Memory Barrier; orders memory
  accesses before/after the barrier within a shareability domain.
* **ARM ARM C6.2.97** (`DSB`): Data Synchronisation Barrier;
  stronger than DMB — completion barrier rather than ordering.
  Consumers: the cross-core TLBI primitive (`Architecture.TlbiForSharing`,
  SM1.E.4) emits `DSB ISH` before broadcast TLBI.
* **ARM ARM C6.2.183** (`ISB`): Instruction Synchronisation Barrier;
  flushes the pipeline.  Consumers: every TLBI / VBAR_EL1 /
  SCTLR_EL1 write sequence in `rust/sele4n-hal/src/mmu.rs`.

### Wait-event coordination (SEV/WFE)

These hardware events are captured at the lock-primitive level
(SM2.B) rather than in the abstract model because they are
liveness primitives (bounded latency on wake-up), not safety
primitives.

* **ARM ARM B2.10** (Local event register): WFE/SEV semantics.
  Each PE has a one-bit local event register that `WFE` waits on
  and `SEV` sets globally.  Documented in `rust/sele4n-hal/src/cpu.rs`
  module docstring per SM1.I.5.
* **ARM ARM C6.2.353** (`WFE`): Wait For Event.  Consumers:
  `cpu.rs::wfe_bounded` — bounded WFE; the bound is enforced via
  the generic timer's `CNTPCT_EL0` register.
* **ARM ARM C6.2.243** (`SEV`): Send Event (global broadcast).
  Consumers: `ticket_lock.rs::release` emits `sev` after the
  `serving.fetch_add(1, Release)`; same for `rw_lock.rs::release_*`.
* **ARM ARM C6.2.244** (`SEVL`): Send Event Local — sets only the
  calling PE's local event register.  Currently unused; reserved
  for SM5+ idle-thread wake primitives.

### Hardware-discipline notes (consumer obligations)

The Lean spec models the hardware semantics operationally, but
the **caller** must still respect ARM ARM-mandated rules.  These
obligations are documented per-call-site in the Rust HAL but
listed here for the SM2.E hardware-discipline closure (SM2.E.6):

1. **8-byte alignment** for AtomicU64 (ARM ARM B2.3.3): both
   `TicketLock` and `RwLock` declare `#[repr(C, align(64))]`,
   over-aligning to the cache line.  False sharing is avoided as
   a side effect.
2. **WFE/SEV pairing** (B2.10): every `SEV` must be preceded by
   a Release-store so observers see the published state before
   they wake.  Both lock impls emit `SEV` AFTER the `Release`
   atomic on `serving` / `state`.
3. **TLBI ordering** (C6.2.97 DSB): cross-core TLB invalidates
   must be DSB-bracketed.  Not part of SM2; covered by SM1.E
   (`Architecture.TlbiForSharing`).
4. **Bounded critical sections** (T_cs): the bounded-wait
   theorems (`ticketLock_bounded_wait`,
   `rwLock_bounded_wait_read/write`) assume the holder releases
   within a bounded number of operations.  Application code that
   holds a lock indefinitely violates the WCRT bound.
5. **No nested same-kind acquire** (LockKind hierarchy, SM0.I):
   `LockKind.level` defines a strict 0..9 hierarchy; SM3+
   per-object locks must respect the order to avoid deadlock.
   Not part of SM2's correctness theorems; covered by SM3.

A single ARM ARM revision (DDI 0487K.a, July 2024 — the current
"K" revision) is the authoritative source for every section
above.  The section numbers are stable across revisions D..K;
the rendered HTML edition is also accepted at the same number.

## Axiom budget

Zero Lean `axioms`.  All hardware semantics enter as operational
constraints on the trace shape; no proof gaps either (no `sorries`).

## Decidability

`MemoryTrace.wellFormed` carries a `Decidable` instance so test
fixtures can construct traces and `decide` their well-formedness at
elaboration time.  `synchronizesWith` and `happensBefore` are
*propositions* (not booleans) — they are used to state lock-primitive
theorems, not to drive runtime control flow, so decidability of the
inductive `happensBefore` is not required.

## File scope and reuse

This file is the entry point for SM2.A; SM2.B
(`Concurrency/Locks/TicketLock.lean`) and SM2.C
(`Concurrency/Locks/RwLock.lean`) import this module to obtain
`MemoryOrder`, `MemoryTrace`, `synchronizesWith`, and the
`happens_before_partial_order` aggregate for their release/acquire
pairing theorems.

/-- **WS-SM SM2.A.1**: ARMv8.1-A / C++20 memory-order tag attached
to every atomic memory event.

* `.relaxed` — no inter-thread synchronisation.  Models the raw
  ARM `LDR` / `STR` of an atomic location without an acquire/release
  suffix.  Used for performance-critical reads of the lock state
  that are immediately followed by a CAS retry.
* `.acquire` — acquire-load.  Models `LDAR` / `LDA*` family; reads
  the location AND establishes a synchronizes-with edge with the
  release-store that produced the observed value.
* `.release` — release-store.  Models `STLR` / `STL*` family; writes
  the location AND publishes every sequenced-before write on this
  core to any acquire-load that observes this value.
* `.acqRel` — both acquire and release semantics.  Models LSE RMW
  ops with both suffixes (`LDAXR`/`STLXR` pairs, `LDADDAL`,
  `CASAL`).  Used by the TicketLock `fetch_add` to capture a ticket.
* `.seqCst` — sequentially consistent.  Models the strongest
  ordering (acquire ∧ release ∧ single-total-order semantics).  Not
  used by v1.0.0 lock primitives but defined for completeness so
  future SM2.x phases can introduce SC ops without changing the
  inductive.

/-- **WS-SM SM2.A.2**: identifier for an atomic memory location.

The lock primitives use a small fixed set of locations:
* TicketLock: 2 locations per instance (`nextTicket`, `serving`).
* RwLock: 1 location per instance (the packed `state`).

The `id` field is an opaque `Nat` here; SM2.B and SM2.C assign
concrete IDs via the module-local helpers below (`nextTicketOf`,
`servingOf`, `rwLockStateOf`).  Each lock instance offsets the
base ID so distinct instances do not alias.

`DecidableEq` lets event predicates that compare locations be
checked at decide-time. -/

`next_ticket: AtomicU64` field at the same offset; the refinement

-- SM2.A.3 — MemoryEvent
-- ============================================================================

/-- **WS-SM SM2.A.3**: an atomic memory operation observed in an
execution.

A trace is a sequence of these events; theorems quantify over all
events in a well-formed trace.  Fields:

* `core` — which `CoreId` executed the event.  Per-core sequencing
  numbers (`seqNum` below) are scoped by this field.
* `loc` — which `AtomicLocation` was read or written.
  `synchronizesWith` requires both endpoints to share this field.
* `isWrite` — true iff the event is a store; false iff it is a load.
  Read-Modify-Write operations (the LSE atomics) are modelled as
  two events with the same `seqNum` (one load + one store).
* `order` — the `MemoryOrder` tag.  Determines which synchronisation
  edges this event can participate in.
* `value` — for stores, the written value; for loads, the observed
  value.  `synchronizesWith` requires equality of this field across
  the release-store / acquire-load pair (the acquire side observes
  the released value).
* `seqNum` — per-core sequencing number.  Same-core events with
  strictly smaller `seqNum` happen-before same-core events with
  larger `seqNum` (this is the `sequencedBefore` relation).  Each
  core emits a monotonically non-decreasing sequence (equal seqNums
  allowed for RMW load + store pairs at one atomic op; strict
  inequality required for `sequencedBefore` to fire).

`DecidableEq` is derived (all fields have `DecidableEq`) so events
can be compared at decide-time and traces can carry `Nodup`. -/

-- ============================================================================
-- SM2.A.5 — wellFormed
-- ============================================================================

/-- **WS-SM SM2.A.5**: well-formedness predicate for a memory trace.

A trace is well-formed iff:

1. **Events are unique** (`Nodup`).  No event appears twice in the
   trace: this rules out the degenerate "same event observed twice"
   case and lets every event have a unique position.
2. **Per-core seqNum monotonicity** (`Pairwise`).  For any two
   events `e₁`, `e₂` that share a core, if `e₁` appears earlier in
   the trace than `e₂`, then `e₁.seqNum ≤ e₂.seqNum`.  Encodes
   ARM ARM K11.2's per-PE program order.

The two clauses together imply that within a single core's view of
the trace (the filtered subsequence of same-core events), the
seqNums are monotonic non-decreasing — which in turn is the
foundation of the happens-before partial order's irreflexivity (the
strict `<` in `sequencedBefore` handles the strictness side).

**Why `≤` (non-strict) and not `<` (strict)?**  ARMv8.1-A LSE atomic
Read-Modify-Write operations (`LDADDA`, `STADDL`, `CASAL`, …) are
modelled at the trace level as TWO events sharing one `seqNum`: a
load with the pre-value and a store with the post-value.  Both
events occur atomically on the same core, so the per-core trace
necessarily contains pairs `(e_load, e_store)` with
`e_load.seqNum = e_store.seqNum`.  A strict `<` would reject all
RMW traces — including `TicketLock.acquire`'s
`next_ticket.fetch_add(1, Acquire)` — which would block SM2.B's
proofs.  The non-strict `≤` allows RMW pairs while still preventing
seqNum DECREASE within a core (the property that drives the
happens-before partial order).  The strict ordering for non-RMW
event pairs is recovered by the per-event `Nodup` clause plus the
strict `<` in `sequencedBefore` (which gates happens-before edges
to genuinely distinct seqNums).

`Pairwise` formulation: `List.Pairwise R l` holds iff for every
pair of elements `(x, y)` with `x` appearing strictly before `y`
in `l`, `R x y` holds.  Decidable when `R` is decidable. -/
def MemoryTrace.wellFormed (t : MemoryTrace) : Prop :=

/-- **WS-SM SM2.A.5**: `wellFormed` is decidable.

Both conjuncts are decidable:

* `Nodup` requires `DecidableEq MemoryEvent` (which we have via
  `deriving DecidableEq`).
* `Pairwise R l` is decidable when `R` is decidable.  Our `R` is
  `e₁.core = e₂.core → e₁.seqNum ≤ e₂.seqNum`, which is the
  implication of two decidable propositions, hence decidable. -/

/-- **Inductive step**: appending a fresh event to a well-formed

event's seqNum, preserves well-formedness.

This is the central operational-semantics lemma that SM2.B
(TicketLock) and SM2.C (RwLock) consume: each operation step
appends one or more events to the trace, and the proof obligation
"the new trace is well-formed" reduces to two side-conditions:

1. The new event is fresh (not already in the trace) — enforced
   by the operational semantics (each event has a unique seqNum
   AND/OR unique location identity).
2. The new event's seqNum is `≥` every prior same-core event's

last index).

This is the canonical "trace order" used by `synchronizesWith` and

`happensBefore` (an event cannot precede itself).

**Note on the Nodup hypothesis**: the lemma deliberately does NOT
take a `Nodup` premise.  The proof relies only on `eventPos` being
a *function* (`idxOf` returns the index of the FIRST occurrence) —
so two events whose first occurrences are at the same index must be
equal, because each index in the list refers to a single element.
The Nodup property is a stronger consequence carried by
`MemoryTrace.wellFormed`, but the position-uniqueness of `eventPos`
holds for any list. -/

/-- **WS-SM SM2.A.6**: synchronizes-with relation on memory events.

An event `e_R` synchronizes-with an event `e_A` iff:

1. Both `e_R` and `e_A` appear in the trace `t`.
2. `e_R` is a release-store: `isWrite = true ∧ order.isRelease`.
3. `e_A` is an acquire-load: `isWrite = false ∧ order.isAcquire`.
4. They access the same atomic location: `e_R.loc = e_A.loc`.
5. The acquire-load observes the released value: `e_R.value = e_A.value`.
6. `e_R` precedes `e_A` in the trace's positional order.

This is the basic synchronisation edge per **ARM ARM B2.3.7** and
the C++20 / Rust release-acquire memory-model rule.  Constructed
into a partial order by the `happensBefore` transitive closure. -/

-- SM2.A.7 — sequencedBefore + happensBefore
-- ============================================================================

/-- **WS-SM SM2.A.7**: per-core sequenced-before order.

An event `e₁` is sequenced-before `e₂` iff both events appear in
the trace, share a core, and `e₁.seqNum < e₂.seqNum`.

Trace membership is required so the per-core view of a well-formed
trace provides positional ordering.  Without it, `sequencedBefore`
would be a pure "this fictitious event would precede that one"
relation that doesn't lift to positions in the actual trace. -/
def sequencedBefore (t : MemoryTrace) (e₁ e₂ : MemoryEvent) : Prop :=
  e₁ ∈ t.events ∧
  e₂ ∈ t.events ∧
  e₁.core = e₂.core ∧
  e₁.seqNum < e₂.seqNum

/-- **WS-SM SM2.A.7**: happens-before relation as an inductive
transitive closure.

The three constructors:

* `.seq sb` — `e₁` is sequenced-before `e₂` (same-core, smaller
  seqNum, both in the trace).
* `.sync sw` — `e_R` synchronizes-with `e_A` (release-store ↦
  matching acquire-load).
* `.trans h₁ h₂` — transitive composition.

The inductive's parameter `t : MemoryTrace` is implicit in every
edge so the per-trace partial-order theorems can be stated uniformly
across all reachable traces.

**ARM ARM K11.2**: `hb` is irreflexive, transitive, antisymmetric
on the events of a well-formed execution; defines a partial order. -/

-- ============================================================================

/-- **Foundational lemma for SM2.A.8/.10**: every `happensBefore`
edge strictly increases the trace position.

This is the inductive invariant that drives both irreflexivity and
antisymmetry: if `happensBefore t e₁ e₂` holds, then
`eventPos t e₁ < eventPos t e₂`, so no event can happens-before
itself and no two distinct events can be mutually hb-related.

Proof: induction on the `happensBefore` derivation.

* `.seq sb`: `sb` says `e₁.core = e₂.core ∧ e₁.seqNum < e₂.seqNum`.
  By `wellFormed`'s Pairwise clause, the same-core seqNum ordering
  implies positional ordering when both events are in the trace.

* `.sync sw`: `sw` includes `eventPos e_R < eventPos e_A` as a
  conjunct directly.

* `.trans h₁ h₂`: by IH, both edges strictly increase position; the
  composition strictly increases position by transitivity of `<`. -/
