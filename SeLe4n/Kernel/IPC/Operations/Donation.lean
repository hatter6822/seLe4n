/-! # Z7: Donation Transport-Dependent Wrappers

SchedContext donation enables passive servers - threads that consume zero CPU
when idle by borrowing the client's SchedContext during IPC Call/Reply.

## Donation Protocol

1. Client calls server via `endpointCall`. If the server is passive (unbound),
   the client's SchedContext is temporarily donated to the server.
2. Server receives `.donated(clientScId, clientTid)` binding. The SchedContext's
   `boundThread` is updated to point to the server.
3. Server runs on the client's CPU budget.
4. Server replies via `endpointReply` or `endpointReplyRecv`. The SchedContext
   is returned to the original client.
5. Server becomes passive again (unbound, not in RunQueue).

## Architecture (post-AN3-A / H-01)

The donation logic is split across two sibling modules:

* `SeLe4n.Kernel.IPC.Operations.Donation.Primitives` - transport-independent
  helpers (`applyCallDonation`, `applyReplyDonation`, all `*_scheduler_eq` /
  `*_machine_eq` / `*_atomicRegion` preservation theorems, server binding
  witnesses). Re-exported by `SeLe4n.Kernel.IPC.Operations` (the IPC operations
  hub).
* This file - donation-aware wrappers around the core transport-layer IPC
  entry points (`endpointCallWithDonation`, `endpointReplyWithDonation`,
  `endpointReplyRecvWithDonation`). These unavoidably depend on
  `SeLe4n.Kernel.IPC.DualQueue.Transport`, so re-exporting this file from
  the operations hub would reintroduce the `Operations -> Donation ->
  Transport -> Core -> Operations` import cycle closed by AI4-A.

Legacy consumers that `import SeLe4n.Kernel.IPC.Operations.Donation` continue
to see the full donation API, because this file re-exports the primitives via
its `import SeLe4n.Kernel.IPC.Operations.Donation.Primitives` line.

This design preserves all existing IPC invariant proofs unchanged - the core
IPC functions are not modified. Donation is applied after the core operation
completes, modifying only `schedContextBinding` fields and RunQueue membership.

## Cross-cutting: Timeout + Donation

When a client's SchedContext is donated to a server and the budget expires:
- The server is preempted (budget exhaustion via `timerTickBudget`)
- The client is timed out (budget-bounded IPC via `timeoutBlockedThreads`)
- The SchedContext returns to the client via timeout cleanup, not reply

/-- Z7: Donation-aware endpointCall. Composes the standard `endpointCall` with
post-call SchedContext donation to passive servers.

Before calling `endpointCall`, checks if the endpoint has a waiting receiver
(handshake path). If so, records the receiver's ThreadId. After `endpointCall`
completes, applies donation from the caller to the receiver if the receiver
was passive (unbound). -/

/-- Z7: Donation-aware endpointReplyRecv. Composes:
1. Standard endpointReplyRecv (reply + receive) — server still holds donated SC during reply
2. Return old donation from replier AFTER the reply completes
3. (New donation from incoming caller is handled by the Call path)

**Ordering rationale (AUD-3)**: The donation return happens AFTER `endpointReplyRecv`
completes, not before. The server needs the donated SchedContext while replying
(it's the currently running thread with that SC's budget). After the reply delivers
the message and the server enters the receive path, the SC is returned. -/
