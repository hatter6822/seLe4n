# S6-F: Device Tree Abstraction

This module defines the `DeviceTree` structure — a platform-independent
representation of board configuration that can be populated either from
hardcoded constants (current approach) or from a parsed device tree blob
(future work for WS-T hardware binding).

## Design rationale

The Raspberry Pi 5 (and most ARM64 platforms) uses device tree blobs (DTBs)
to describe hardware topology at boot time. The bootloader (ARM Trusted
Firmware / U-Boot) passes a DTB pointer to the kernel, which parses it to
discover:

- Physical memory regions (RAM, device, reserved)
- Peripheral base addresses (UART, GIC, timers)
- Interrupt controller configuration
- CPU topology

Currently, `RPi5/Board.lean` hardcodes these values. This module provides
an abstraction layer so that:

1. **Static validation**: `DeviceTree.fromBoardConstants` constructs a
   `DeviceTree` from hardcoded constants, enabling compile-time consistency
   checks.
2. **Future DTB parsing**: `DeviceTree.fromDtb` (stub) will construct a
   `DeviceTree` from a raw DTB byte array, enabling runtime discovery.
3. **Platform-independent kernel**: The kernel operates on `DeviceTree`
   values, not platform-specific constants.

## Status

S6-F preparation — structure and static constructor defined. DTB parsing
is deferred to WS-T (Raspberry Pi 5 Hardware Binding).

/-- S6-F: A peripheral device entry in the device tree.
    Describes a single MMIO-mapped hardware peripheral. -/
structure DeviceEntry where
  /-- Human-readable name (e.g., "uart0", "gic-distributor"). -/
  name : String
  /-- Base physical address of the peripheral's register space. -/

  /-- Size of the register space in bytes. -/

/-- S6-F: Platform board configuration parsed from device tree or constants.

    This structure captures all hardware-specific parameters that the kernel
    needs to configure itself at boot time. It serves as the single source
    of truth for platform configuration, replacing scattered hardcoded
    constants.

    **Invariant**: `memoryMap` must satisfy `MachineConfig.wellFormed` when
    combined with `machineConfig`. This is checked by `DeviceTree.validate`. -/
structure DeviceTree where
  /-- Platform identification string. -/
  platformName : String
  /-- Architectural parameters (register width, address widths, page size). -/
  machineConfig : MachineConfig
  /-- Peripheral devices discovered from the device tree. -/
  peripherals : List DeviceEntry
  /-- Interrupt controller configuration. -/
  interruptController : InterruptControllerInfo
  /-- Timer frequency in Hz (from CNTFRQ_EL0 or device tree). -/
  timerFrequencyHz : Nat
  /-- Debug console UART base address. -/
  debugUartBase : Option PAddr := none
  deriving Repr

/-- S6-F: Validate that a device tree's machine configuration is well-formed.
    Returns `true` iff the memory map has non-overlapping regions with valid
    sizes, and all region addresses fit within the physical address width. -/
def DeviceTree.validate (dt : DeviceTree) : Bool :=
  dt.machineConfig.wellFormed

/-- S6-F: Construct a `DeviceTree` from hardcoded board constants.
    This is the current path — all values come from compile-time constants
    in `RPi5/Board.lean`. The result can be validated at compile time via
    `native_decide` on `DeviceTree.validate`. -/

/-- S6-F: Stub for future DTB parsing.
    Will construct a `DeviceTree` from a raw device tree blob byte array.
    Returns `none` if the DTB is malformed or contains unsupported nodes.

    **WS-T**: This function will be implemented during the Raspberry Pi 5
    hardware binding workstream. The DTB format follows the Devicetree
    Specification (v0.4) — a flattened tree of nodes with properties,
    starting with an `fdt_header` structure. -/
