# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-02-17

### CI / Tooling reliability
- Updated `scripts/setup_lean_env.sh` to install `ripgrep` (`rg`) when missing, matching Tier-3/Tier-4 script requirements and preventing CI failures where `rg` is unavailable.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-02-17

### CI / Tooling reliability
- Fixed `scripts/setup_lean_env.sh` to source existing elan env before probing/installing, preventing redundant reinstall attempts in CI shells that do not persist PATH changes.
- Fixed `scripts/setup_lean_env.sh` to treat already-installed Lean toolchains as a success path, preventing CI failures when `leanprover/lean4:v4.27.0` is present.
