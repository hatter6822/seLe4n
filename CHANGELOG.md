# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [0.8.7] - 2026-02-17

### Tooling setup optimization
- Refactored `scripts/setup_lean_env.sh` to share package-manager helpers and perform `apt-get update` at most once even when both `shellcheck` and `ripgrep` are missing.
- Preserved all existing installer behavior while reducing duplicated setup work/noise in cold environments.

## [0.8.6] - 2026-02-17

### Audit/Sync hardening
- Performed full post-WS-A2 repository validation sweep (`test_fast`, `test_smoke`, `test_full`, `test_nightly`) and confirmed all tiers pass without regressions.
- Synchronized roadmap and audit-context docs so M7 status explicitly reflects WS-A1/WS-A2 as completed while preserving historical audit snapshot intent.
- Clarified historical audit caveat language so architecture criticisms about IPC split are interpreted as pre-remediation findings, not current-state defects.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-02-17

### Architecture / API modularity (WS-A2)
- Split IPC transition semantics into `SeLe4n/Kernel/IPC/Operations.lean` and retained invariant/proof obligations in `SeLe4n/Kernel/IPC/Invariant.lean` to restore operations/invariant symmetry.
- Kept `SeLe4n/Kernel/API.lean` as the stable external facade while explicitly exporting IPC operations and invariant surfaces.
- Updated development documentation and GitBook architecture maps/workstream tracking to mark WS-A2 complete with closure evidence.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-02-17

### CI / Tooling reliability
- Updated `scripts/setup_lean_env.sh` to install `ripgrep` (`rg`) when missing, matching Tier-3/Tier-4 script requirements and preventing CI failures where `rg` is unavailable.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-02-17

### CI / Tooling reliability
- Fixed `scripts/setup_lean_env.sh` to source existing elan env before probing/installing, preventing redundant reinstall attempts in CI shells that do not persist PATH changes.
- Fixed `scripts/setup_lean_env.sh` to treat already-installed Lean toolchains as a success path, preventing CI failures when `leanprover/lean4:v4.27.0` is present.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-17

### Documentation
- Added root `CONTRIBUTING.md` pointer to canonical contributor workflow in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- Added root `CHANGELOG.md` for chronological release notes and milestone-delivery traceability.
- Added post-audit remediation note in `docs/REPOSITORY_AUDIT.md` clarifying WS-A1 CI hardening landed after the audit snapshot.

### CI / Quality Gates
- Added Tier 3/WS-A1 documentation anchor checks for CI policy/workflow artifacts and root contributor/changelog discoverability in `scripts/test_tier3_invariant_surface.sh`.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-17

### CI / Quality Gates (WS-A1)
- Promoted Tier 3 (`test_full.sh`) into CI merge-gate flow.
- Added nightly determinism workflow running `NIGHTLY_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=1 ./scripts/test_nightly.sh`.
- Added canonical branch-protection policy doc `docs/CI_POLICY.md`.
- Added Lean/Lake cache restoration in CI workflows.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-17

### Baseline
- M6 complete / M7 active audit-remediation baseline.
